# Simple Responsible Co-founding

**50/50 ownership** - Co-founding is like a marriage and you wouldn't want an 80/20 marriage.

**Bootstrapping** - The VC hamster wheel is hard to get on and harder still to keep pace.

**Moonlighting** - Most people can't afford to quit their job.  You can afford 8 hours a week.

**Non-tech founder's idea** - By devs, for devs is saturated.

**This week** - You'll never get a 'good week' to start.

### Step 0:
Hit up people you respect.  Ask them if they know someone that's able to start something like this.

### Step 1: 
Non-techie finds customers, techie builds the thing

### Step 2:
Start making revenue/profit

### Step 3:
When your profit reached enough to pay a founder, they go full time.
