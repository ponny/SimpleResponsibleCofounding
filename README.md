# Simple Responsible Co-founding
**50/50 ownership** - Co-founding is like a marriage and you wouldn't want an 80/20 marriage.
**Bootstrapping** - The VC hamster wheel is hard to get on and harder still to keep pace.
**Moonlighting** - Most people can't afford to quit their job.  You can afford 8 hours a week.
**Non-tech founder's idea** - By devs, for devs is saturated.
**This week** - You'll never get a 'good week' to start.

### Step 0:
Hit up people you respect.  Ask them if they know someone that's able to start something like this.
